# Flutter LWP example

Example of how flutter_lwp can be used.

# Lego Buggy

The example code allows control of Lego Buggy (42124), and is IMHO better than the
OEM control, which was very jittery. Remember to hit calibrate at least once with the wheels
off the ground. The UI will adapt to landscape vs portrait mode, but really landscape is 
easiest to control.
